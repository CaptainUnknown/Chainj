                  <p> Volunteers can provide their services in a variety of ways and at various times thanks to Mission® Packages. Upgrades are available in packages, allowing Volunteers to schedule their assistance for a basic duration longer than an hour. </p>
                  <p> The Volunteer can describe their Mission and its terms on the Mission® Page, and the Mentor can buy the Mission and place an order there. </p>
                  <p> Services are provided by Mission® / Missions® on Chainj. </p>
                  <p> An unique logo design submitted by a volunteer using the Chainj Logo Maker is called a logo design. </p>
                  <p> On the Order Page, Mentors and Volunteers can contact with one another regarding an ordered Mission. </p>
                  <p> Orders are the official contracts reached once a volunteer's mission page was used to establish an engagement. </p>
                  <p> Users that offer and carry out services through Missions are known as volunteers. </p>
                  <h3> OVERVIEW (Main terms, in a nutshell) </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> On Chainj, only registered users may buy and serve. It costs nothing to sign up. By creating an account, you undertake to supply us with true, complete, and up-to-date information and not to do so fraudulently or deceptively. Your password's security and secrecy are your exclusive responsibility, as is any activity on your account. Any actions or inactions you take in relation to your account are not our responsibility. On Chainj, missions may start at a basic starting time of 1. Depending on the Volunteer's assessment, some Missions are available at base times greater than 1. Chainj is paid upfront by Mentors to generate an order (see Payment Terms). </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Orders can be placed by using a Custom Offer or the Order button on a volunteer's mission page. Please review the Payment Terms for fees and payments. </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Volunteers are required to carry out their commands and are not permitted to revoke orders routinely or without justification. Order cancellations will harm the standing and reputation of Volunteers. Depending on their output and reputation, volunteers can advance their account statuses (Levels). Benefits of advanced levels include the ability to sell their Mission in multiples or offer services for higher times through Mission Extras. Users are only allowed to place orders through Chainj.io and cannot offer or accept money in any other way. Mentors who purchase a Mission are given full ownership of the provided work, unless the Volunteer specifies otherwise on their Mission page. Please take note that some missions charge extra fees (through Mission Extras) for commercial use licences. For more details, please see the "Ownership" and "Commercial Use License" sections listed below. All published produced works and Logo Designs may be used by Chainj for marketing and promotional activities. We respect your right to privacy. Here is a link to our privacy statement. </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> In addition to these Terms of Service, as they may be revised from time to time, users agree to abide by Chainj's Community Standards, which are a set of conduct norms and principles that apply to the Chainj community and marketplace. Users of Chainj can access the Logo Maker, which enables some Volunteers to provide a variety of unique logo ideas that Mentors can then change and customise in accordance with their own unique requirements utilising unique automated design tools. Mentors buy the full commercial use rights to the Logo Design that includes their brand name through the Logo Maker. </p>
                  <h2> VOLUNTEERS </h2>
                  <h3> Basics  </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> On Chainj, volunteers build Missions that Mentors can purchase in order to use their services. In addition to their Missions, Volunteers can also make Custom Offers to their Mentors. Amounts equal to 80% of the purchase price are credited to your account for each Mission you sell and successfully complete. When an order is finished, Chainj approves Volunteers. A definition of a finished order can be found in the section below under "Orders" See the Payment Terms for further details on receiving payments, fees, and taxes. Volunteers are not permitted to use the Google Ads platform to advertise their Missions or any other Chainj content. Based on the order ratings submitted by Mentors or Business Account Team Members, the Volunteer's rating is determined. Advanced Volunteer levels can be attained by Volunteers with high ratings (see Levels below). Extremely poor ratings in some circumstances can result in the Volunteer's account being suspended. Chainj may temporarily block a Volunteer's ability to withdraw money due to security concerns in order to stop fraudulent or illegal activities. This might happen due to security concerns, questionable behaviour that has been reported by other users, or connecting several Chainj accounts to the same withdrawal provider. It is the responsibility of volunteers to secure general liability insurance coverage with adequate limits to cover all risks related to providing their services. </p>
                  <h3> Missions®   </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> Depending on their Level status, volunteers are only permitted to submit a certain number of current Missions: </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> 7 Missions for volunteers without a Level status; </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> 10 Missions for Level 1 volunteers; </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> 20 Missions for Level 2 volunteers; </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> 30 Missions for Top Rated Volunteers. On Chainj, missions are examples of user-generated content. For violations of these Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards, Chainj has the right to remove missions and/or users from the website. These violations and/or materials may include, but are not limited to:</p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Unlawful or dishonest services </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Violations of a third party's terms of service, copyright infringement, and trademark infringement are notified through our intellectual property claims policy, which can be found here. </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Adult-oriented services, pornographic, inappropriate/obscene </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Intentional copies of missions </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Spam, nonsense, violent, or deceptive missions </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Missions that mislead Mentors or others </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Reselling of regulated goods </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Offering to write academic papers for Mentors </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Extremely poor missions </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Promoting Chainj and/or Chainj Missions through actions that are against the law, the rules, or the rights of third parties Account suspension for volunteers whose missions are withdrawn due to the aforementioned infractions Missions that are terminated for infractions are not eligible for editing or restoration. </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Missions may include pre-approved website URLs contained within the Mission description and requirements box. Missions may be deleted from our Search feature due to subpar performance and/or user misconduct. Websites that promote content that is against Chainj's Terms of Service and/or our Community Standards will be removed from missions. Every mission must have a mission image that is appropriate for the service being given. All Volunteers have the option to post two more photographs related to the Mission. Volunteers are expected to provide the same level of assistance as depicted in their Mission pictures. Instances of recurrent deliveries that fall short of the standard depicted in the Mission pictures may result in the account of the Volunteer losing Volunteer status or becoming permanently disabled. An authorised Mission Video may be posted as part of a Mission using the Chainj mission management tools. It is forbidden to make claims on the Mission Page that contradict or go around these Terms of Service. For the purpose of providing their services in structured formats with numerous time points for the chosen Mission, eligible Missions in certain Categories may build up Mission Packages. Only Pro Volunteers have access to some categories when creating Missions. Making a Mission for services that are only available to Pros may result in the removal of your Mission if you are not a Pro Volunteer. </p>
                  <h3> MISSION® EXTRAS </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> Mission Extras are extra services that are provided over and above the Volunteer's Mission for a period of time that the Volunteer specifies. For breaking our Terms of Service and/or Community Standards, Mission Extras may be deleted. For a list of services that are prohibited under our Terms of Service, please refer to the Missions section above. If breaches are discovered in Mission Extras, missions may be removed. Your Volunteer Level determines the number of Mission Extras that can be supplied and the duration of each Mission Extra. You may read more about your account's qualification for Mission Extras here. </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Services provided through Mission Extras must be associated with the base service and a component of the Order's deliverables. Different service categories that are parts of a better quality service that is given may be covered by mission extras. For each Mission Extra that is added to an Order, Volunteers have the option of extending its duration. This is to account for the extra time required to complete the service. </p>
                  <h3> Levels </h3>
                  <p> Chainj focuses on assisting volunteers in utilising their expertise. Our goal is to provide top-performing Volunteers with practical tools to expand their businesses. Customers may be happier when volunteers invest in self-promotion. Additionally, Chainj may reward them with additional statuses, exclusive opportunities, bonuses, and tools if they deliver on time and maintain excellent quality and ratings. </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Account Levels are awarded to Chainj Volunteers based on their performance, reputation, and activity. You may find the progression requirements here. An automated system frequently updates Level Advancement. Currently, a volunteer can advance to Level 1, Level 2, and Top Rated. Volunteers run the risk of losing their volunteer status and all the perks that go along with it if they are unable to maintain their high quality service, see a sharp decline in ratings, or stop delivering on time. For instance, cancellations, warnings to the Volunteer's account, and delayed deliveries can all result in a Volunteer moving to a different Level. Advanced levels offer their owners further perks, such as the ability to sell their Mission in multiples or offer Missions for greater times through Mission Extras. </p>
                  <h3> TOP RATED VOLUNTEERS </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> Top Rated Volunteers are hand-selected by Chainj editors as part of an ongoing review process based on seniority, sales volume, exceptionally high ratings, great customer service, a high order completion rate, and leadership in the community. Top Rated Volunteers have access to more features than lower levels, such as VIP support and exclusive access to beta features. Chainj continuously assesses Top Rated eligibility to make sure that the criteria and standards for the Top Rated designation are met. In light of this evaluation, Chainj reserves the right to modify a Top Rated Volunteer's status. Additionally, Top Rated Volunteers run the risk of losing their Top Rated status and the perks that come with it if they are unable to maintain their high quality service through a sharp decline in ratings, cease delivering on time, experience an increase in cancellation rates, or transgress our Terms of Service and/or Community Standards. </p>
                  <h3> Pro Volunteers </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> Pro Volunteers go through a vetting process by Chainj editors and are pre-verified professionals. Everyone is eligible to apply for Chainj Pro, including experienced freelancers who are new to Chainj and current Chainj Volunteers. Chainj continuously assesses Pro Volunteers' eligibility to verify that the requirements and standards for Pro Volunteer selection are met. In response to such an evaluation, Chainj reserves the right to modify a Pro Volunteer status. Additionally, Pro Volunteers run the danger of losing their Pro status and the perks that come with it if they are unable to continue their high quality service due to a sharp decline in ratings, stop delivering on time, an increase in cancellation rate, or a violation of our Terms of Service. </p>
                  <h3> Chainj Business Catalog </h3>
                  <p> A freelance platform designed specifically for larger teams and corporations is called Chainj Business. On the Chainj Business catalogue, volunteers are expected to adhere to particular ethical criteria. In order to maintain their high standards of professionalism, Chainj will periodically evaluate eligible Volunteers whose Missions are included in the Chainj Business catalogue. Volunteers and Missions may be removed from the Chainj Business catalogue at Chainj's discretion. </p>
                  <p> Volunteer Contribution </p>
                  <p> Chainj Volunteers have access to a number of special features that allow them to tailor the services they provide. </p>
                  <h3> CUSTOM OFFER </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> Volunteers can also send Custom Offers that speak to a Mentor's particular needs. The Volunteer defines Custom Offers, including the precise service description, delivery time, and delivery time estimate. From the chat page, you can send Custom Offers. The Terms of Service and/or Community Standards of Chainj may not be violated by services offered through Custom Offers. </p>
                  <h3> PROJECT MILESTONES </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> Mission and Custom Offers above 1 may include a project with a minimum of two milestones and a maximum of six milestones. The minimum amount for each milestone is 0. According to the timelines and details of each Mission or Custom Offer, each milestone is paid for separately. Following the delivery and completion of a milestone, Mentors have the option of continuing the Order and paying for the subsequent milestone or stopping the Order. After the previous milestones have been accepted, the Order under the subsequent milestones will not begin if Mentor does not pay for it within 10 days. If no request for change or acceptance is made within eight days of a milestone being reported as delivered, the milestone will be automatically declared as complete. In this scenario, however, no other milestones will begin. </p>
                  <p> a fixed-term subscription for a particular Mission (the "Mission Subscription") may be made available to Mentors by volunteers. Volunteer will consistently fulfil one Order of the same Mission during the Mission Subscription period, as agreed upon between Volunteer and Mentor. Future Orders ordered by Mentors under the Mission Subscription may be cancelled before payment is made for such Orders. The Orders under the Mission Subscription will be cancelled as necessary in this situation. After payment has been received, Chainj's Order Cancelation policy as stated in the Payments Terms will be in effect. Volunteers have up to 10 days before the following consecutive Order to cancel their Mission Subscription. If not, the Order Cancelation procedure outlined in the Payments Terms will be in effect with Chainj. </p>
                  <h3> TRANSPORTING ACTUAL DELIVERABLES </h3>
                  <p> On Chainj, some services are physically provided. Volunteers may choose to specify a fiat gift component towards costs for these kinds of Missions. </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> Physical deliverables for missions with a fiat gift component must be given to Mentors. Fiat shipping fees only apply to the price Volunteers must pay to send tangible objects to Mentors. A shipping address must be provided by Mentors who purchase Missions that must be physically delivered. Once the Mentor gives the shipping address, the Volunteer is in charge of making all shipping arrangements. Chainj is not liable or responsible for any shipping-related damages or other issues, nor does it handle or guarantee the quality, condition, or delivery of the items. A tracking number is a wonderful tool for preventing shipping-related issues. When delivering your work, we ask that you enter the tracking number if one is provided on the Order Page. </p>
                  <h2> MENTORS </h2>
                  <h3> Basics </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> You are not permitted to pay Volunteers directly using payment methods from sources other than the Chainj platform. All delivered, publicly accessible works are reserved for use by Chainj in its marketing and public relations initiatives. Through the Post a Request feature, Mentors can ask for a certain service. Services must be available on Chainj in order to be requested. To view the policies on authorised services, please go here. Users should not use Chainj's Post a Request tool for anything other than service requests. </p>
                  <h3> PURCHASING  </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> For information on making payments through the Chainj platform as well as about subscription costs and taxes, please refer to the Payment Terms. Additionally, Mentors can use the website to request a Custom Order that meets their individual needs and obtain a Custom Offer from Volunteers. You are not permitted to request payment from Volunteers or to make payments in any other way than through the Chainj.io website. If you were instructed to utilise a different payment method, please let customer support know right away. </p>
                  <h2> ORDERS </h2>
                  <h3> Basics </h3>
                  <p> Your order will be made and assigned a special Chainj order number (#FO) as soon as payment is completed. According to the service that was purchased and promoted on their Mission, volunteers must produce finished files and/or proof of work via the Deliver Work button, which can be found on the Order page. Volunteers may not misuse the Deliver Work button to go around the Order restrictions outlined in these Terms of Service. If an Order was not completed and the "Deliver Work" option was used, the Order might be cancelled after review, the Volunteer's rating might be impacted, and the Volunteer might receive a warning. When an order is marked as delivered, accepted by a Mentor, and then marked as complete. If an Order is not accepted and no request for change is made within three days of the Order being marked as Delivered, it will be automatically designated as Complete. The Mentor may add up to an extra 5 days to this time frame. We encourage our Mentors and Volunteers to attempt inter-personal conflict resolution. Customers can get help from Chainj's Customer Support department if, for any reason, this doesn't work after using the Resolution Center or if they run into instances of non-permitted usage on the Site. Please see the Payment Terms for further details on disputes, order cancellations, and refunds. Once the Mentor has made payment, orders placed through the Logo Maker are finished. After a milestone has been supplied by the Volunteer and acknowledged by the Mentor, it is indicated as Complete (on an Order with milestones). If no request for modification or acceptance was made within 8 days of the milestone being marked as delivered, it will be automatically declared as complete. In this instance, the Order will be halted and no additional milestones will begin. Mentors have the option to either continue with the Order and pay for the following milestone when a milestone has been delivered and acknowledged, or to stop the Order. After the previous milestones have been accepted, the Order under the subsequent milestones will not begin if Mentor does not pay for it within 10 days. Please be aware that the current ordered milestone will not be revoked if you decide to discontinue the future milestones. If a Mission Subscription is offered on the Volunteer's Mission page, Mentors may purchase one. As agreed upon by the Volunteer and Mentor, a new Order of the same Mission will be automatically generated on a recurrent basis throughout the Mission Subscription term. You give us permission to automatically deduct the cost of each Order placed under the Mission Subscription from your Chainj Balance or from a previously saved payment method, as appropriate, by purchasing a Mission Subscription. You will be asked to approve the payment before the next Order if you don't have any Chainj Balance or a saved payment method. The Orders under the Mission Subscription will be cancelled in the event that a payment is not processed or made by Mentor for any other reason. Additionally, before the Mission Subscription's future Orders are paid for, the Mentor may cancel them. Following receipt of payment, Chainj's Order Cancelation policy as stated in the Payments Terms shall take effect. Please be aware that Volunteers have 10 days before the following Order in a Mission Subscription to cancel future Orders. In order for the Volunteer to provide the service, certain Missions that provide local services may require Mentors and Volunteers to meet in person. Users should be aware that in these situations, Chainj cannot guarantee the actions, morals, suitability, or skills of either Mentors or Volunteers. Both Mentors and Volunteers acknowledge that Chainj has no obligation or liability for any local services offered by the Volunteers, and that they bear the whole risk associated with their meeting and/or the usage or execution of local services. Mentors are recommended to keep up appropriate insurance coverage to protect their liability as the property owner in the event that the service is rendered on the Mentors' property. Orders completed outside of the marketplace are still subject to Chainj's Terms of Service and Community Standards (including, among others, the below restrictions on Unlawful Use, Inappropriate Behavior & Language, and Targeted Abuse). </p>
                  <h3> MINTING  </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> For information on rewarding Volunteers for their time provided, please see the Chainj minting conditions, donations, and fiat gift considerations. </p>
                  <h3> ASSESSING ORDERS </h3>
                  <p> Even if volunteering is a worthy cause and is unpaid, it still requires honesty, perseverance, and . As a result, the service must be carried out with the Volunteer's best interests in mind. * The Volunteer receives email and website notifications whenever a Mentor requests a Mission. The delivery time that volunteers indicated when they created their Missions must be met. When an Order is designated as late, failing to comply will allow the Mentor to cancel it, which could impair the Volunteer's status. To mark the Order as Delivered, volunteers must deliver finished files and/or evidence of work using the Deliver Completed Work button (found on the Order page). Users are in charge of checking any transferred files for malware and viruses. Chainj disclaims any liability for any losses that may result from the use of the website, the use of the content, or the transfer of files. If the delivered materials do not match the Volunteer's description on their Mission page or they do not match the requirements sent to the Volunteer at the beginning of the order process, Mentors may use the "Request Revisions" feature located on the Order Page while an Order is marked as Delivered. </p>
                  <h3> REVIEWS </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> A crucial component of Chainj's ranking system is the feedback reviews that Mentors submit after completing an Order. Reviews show how the Mentor felt about the Volunteers and their work in general. Mentors are urged to express to the Volunteer any issues they have with the service they received from the Volunteer while their order is still in effect. A Mentor's fundamental right is to provide input. Unless there are blatant violations of our Community Standards and/or Terms of Service, feedback reviews won't be deleted. All feedback reviews must be for legitimate services provided solely through the Chainj platform by members of our Community in order to prevent any abuse of our feedback system. All associated accounts will be permanently suspended for any transactions that are planned, found to artificially boost Volunteer ratings, or found to abuse the Chainj platform with purchases from additional accounts. Mentors' feedback remarks are made public on the Volunteer's Mission page. The delivered photos and videos that are provided to a Mentor in a delivery message are called Work Samples. If a Mentor chooses to publish a Work Sample while giving a public feedback review, the Work Sample will be added to the Volunteer's Live Portfolio on their Mission page. * Withholding the delivery of services, files, or information necessary to complete the Mission's service in an effort to obtain positive reviews or additional services is prohibited. </p>
                  <p className='bullets'>Posting a review and responding: The Mentor has three days to reply when the work is delivered. The Order will be deemed finished if no answer is received within the allotted time frame. Up to 10 days after an Order is marked as complete, users may post reviews on it. After 10 days, no additional reviews may be added to an Order. By mutual cancellations, Volunteers may not request the removal of feedback reviews from their Mentors. The Volunteer will be notified once the Mentor gives his or her review and will also have the chance to post a review regarding working with the Mentor. Please take note that Volunteers cannot view the Mentor's review at this time. All posted reviews become public once both Volunteer and Mentor have finished their reviews or after 10 days have passed. </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> </p>
                  <p className='bullets'> After both the Mentor's and Volunteer's evaluations have been posted, the Volunteer can react to the Mentor's review from the Order page, which can be found on the Volunteer's Mission page beneath the Mentor's comments. Reviews and feedback are not accessible for purchases made using the Logo Maker. </p>
                  <h3> Conflicts and Refunds </h3>
                  <p> We encourage our Mentors and Volunteers to attempt inter-personal conflict resolution. Customers can get help from Chainj's Customer Support department if, for any reason, this doesn't work after using the Resolution Center or if they run into instances of non-permitted usage on the Site.

                  <h3> CONDUCT AND PROTECTION OF USERS </h3>
                  <p> With the help of Chainj, anyone may build, distribute, volunteer, and use almost any service they require at an unbelievable price. The variety of services available on Chainj showcases the growing Compassion economy. Orders, social media, and the Chainj Community Forums are used by community members to interact and communicate. </p>
                  <p> Chainj upholds a welcoming, civic-minded, and professional atmosphere. Users should uphold that spirit while engaging in any Chainj activities or extensions. The expected behaviour that users are required to uphold while communicating with one another on Chainj is covered in this section.  </p>
                  <p> Please get in touch with our Customer Support staff if you notice any violations of our Terms of Service, Community Standards, or User Misconduct, or if you have any questions about your account. </p>
                  <h3> Basics </h3>
                  <p className='bullets'> Chainj's dedication to the worth of every human life comes first. Any Chainj Members who cause conflict among other Members will receive a warning or, in accordance with our rules for three strikes, have their accounts suspended or removed. </p>
                  <p> The identities of our users are kept secret to preserve their privacy. In order to go around or misuse the Chainj message system or Chainj platform, it is not allowed to request or provide email addresses, Skype or IM usernames, phone numbers, or any other private contact information. Any exchange of personal data necessary to maintain a service may take place on the Order Page. Chainj makes no guarantees on the quality of service provided to Mentors. The dispute resolution resources offered to you on the Order Page are available for use. Users that communicate with one another outside of the Chainj platform are not protected by Chainj. Exchanges of data and files are limited to using Chainj's platform only. Messages that are rude, abusive, use foul language, or are violent won't be accepted and could get you a warning or get your account suspended or removed. Everyone is welcome on Chainj. You agree not to discriminate against any other user on the basis of their gender, colour, age, connection with a particular religion, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic, and you understand that doing so could lead to the suspension or deletion of your account. Users are not allowed to post proposals or contact parties they have met through Chainj to negotiate a deal or collect payment from them elsewhere. </p>
                  <h3> ORDERS </h3>
                  <p> Users who place orders from competitive services with the goal to disparage rival Volunteers will have their reviews removed, and our Trust & Safety team may take additional account status-related action. The removal or modification of reviews or the cancellation of orders that do not adhere to the Order Cancellation or Feedback standards should not be pursued by users through spamming, soliciting former Mentors or Volunteers, or other means. </p>
                  <h3> MISSIONS </h3>
                  <p> Users can report missions to customer support if they believe they may be in violation of Chainj's terms of service due to their replication of comparable services already available (copycat missions). Volunteers represent and warrant that any content included in their Missions is original, created by the Volunteers, and does not violate the rights of any third party, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, or service marks. In the case that any music or stock video is used in the Missions, the Volunteers represent and warrant that they have the right to use the music and/or video in question and to include it into the Missions. Chainj will respond to reports of alleged copyright or trademark infringement that are precise and comprehensive. You can see our intellectual property claims policies here. </p>
